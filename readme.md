## IMDB Dataset Analysis

IMDB (Internet Movie Database) is the world's largest source for everything related to movies, tv shows and so on. In this notebook, I'll try to analyze some data from IMDB to answer some interesting questions using Python.

**Questions like---**

 - What kind of data does the IMDB online databse cover and host?
 - What kind of ratigs do people give in general? What movies get the
   best ratings and whether it's a normal distribution?
 - Based on my favpourite movies, which ones should I also check next
   time?

The dataset was downloaded from https://datasets.imdbws.com. In my analysis, I'll focus on mainly 2 datasets (title.basics and title.ratings) which offers 9 and 3 features respectively that include the title ID, name, type, adult movie flag, genre, ratings and the number of votes a title has received. The datasets contain data up to January 2nd, 2023.

The datasets are not included in this repository, since they are very large files (more than 1GB) for github to host. Please download the datasets from the link given above.

All the steps are explained in details inside the notebook file.
